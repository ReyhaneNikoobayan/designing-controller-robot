**In this project, I first designed a model for the robotâ€™s motors.**

**Then I applied a 48-volt input to each motor for 3 seconds.**

**Joint States**

**In the Third part, I designed a PID controller for each joint so that they meet these requirement:**

- settling time is about 1 second
-  the overshoot is less than 5%.

**Which resulted in following controllers:**

First & Second Joints

**In the final stage, I implemented a trajectory on the robot with the designed controller:**
